Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am currently a [Senior Lecturer - Information Systems specializing in Digital Ethics](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/862627-marc-cheong),
Associate Director at the [Centre for AI and Digital Ethics](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/caide/people)
and an Honorary Senior Fellow at the [Melbourne Law School](https://law.unimelb.edu.au/about/staff#honoraries).
all at The University of Melbourne (formerly Senior Research Fellow in Digital Ethics, 2020-2021).

I am also an Honorary Burnet Institute Senior Fellow at [The Burnet Institute](https://burnet.edu.au/).

My research interest is in social network analysis and interdisciplinary applications of both continental and analytic philosophy + data science empirical methods + information systems methodologies.
  
With over ten years of academic experience, I am committed to facilitating quality interdisciplinary research and education: with a strong background in data science, social media analysis, and philosophical rigour.
