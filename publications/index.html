class="abstract hidden"> <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly being used not only to classify and analyze but also to generate images and text. As recent work on the content produced by text and image Generative AIs has shown (e.g., Cheong et al., 2024, Acerbi &amp; Stubbersfield, 2023), there is a risk that harms of representation and bias, already documented in prior AI and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms may also be present in generative models. These harms relate to protected categories such as gender, race, age, and religion. There are several kinds of harms of representation to consider in this context, including stereotyping, lack of recognition, denigration, under-representation, and many others (Crawford in Soundings 41:45–55, 2009; in: Barocas et al., SIGCIS Conference, 2017). Whereas the bulk of researchers’ attention thus far has been given to stereotyping and denigration, in this study we examine ‘exnomination’, as conceived by Roland Barthes (1972), of religious groups. Our case study is DALL-E, a tool that generates images from natural language prompts. Using DALL-E mini, we generate images from generic prompts such as “religious person.” We then examine whether the generated images are recognizably members of a nominated group. Thus, we assess whether the generated images normalize some religions while neglecting others. We hypothesize that Christianity will be recognizably represented more frequently than other religious groups. Our results partially support this hypothesis but introduce further complexities, which we then explore.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Alfano2024-hn" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Moral universals: A machine-reading analysis of 256 societies</div> <div class="author"> Mark Alfano, <em>Marc Cheong</em>, and Oliver Scott Curry </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e25940" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>What is the cross-cultural prevalence of the seven moral values posited by the theory of "morality-as-cooperation"? Previous research, using laborious hand-coding of ethnographic accounts of ethics from 60 societies, found examples of most of the seven morals in most societies, and observed these morals with equal frequency across cultural regions. Here we replicate and extend this analysis by developing a new Morality-as-Cooperation Dictionary (MAC-D) and using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) to machine-code ethnographic accounts of morality from an additional 196 societies (the entire Human Relations Area Files, or HRAF, corpus). Again, we find evidence of most of the seven morals in most societies, across all cultural regions. The new method allows us to detect minor variations in morals across region and subsistence strategy. And we successfully validate the new machine-coding against the previous hand-coding. In light of these findings, MAC-D emerges as a theoretically-motivated, comprehensive, and validated tool for machine-reading moral corpora. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the current study, as well as prospects for future research.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Cheong2024-ug" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Investigating gender and racial biases in DALL-E Mini Images</div> <div class="author"> <em>Marc Cheong</em>, Ehsan Abedin, Marinus Ferreira, Ritsaart Willem Reimann, Shalom Chalson, Pamela Robinson, Joanne Byrne, Leah Ruppanner, Mark Alfano, and Colin Klein </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/CHEIGA-2" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Generative artificial intelligence systems based on transformers, including both text generators such as GPT-4 and image generators such as DALL-E 3, have recently entered the popular consciousness. These tools, while impressive, are liable to reproduce, exacerbate, and reinforce extant human social biases, such as gender and racial biases. In this article, we systematically review the extent to which DALL-E Mini suffers from this problem. In line with the Model Card published alongside DALL-E Mini by its creators, we find that the images it produces tend to represent dozens of different occupations as populated either solely by men (e.g., pilot, builder, plumber) or solely by women (e.g., hairdresser, receptionist, dietitian). In addition, the images DALL-E Mini produces tend to represent most occupations as populated primarily or solely by White people (e.g., farmer, painter, prison officer, software engineer) and very few by non-White people (e.g., pastor, rapper). These findings suggest that exciting new AI technologies should be critically scrutinized and perhaps regulated before they are unleashed on society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Paltiel2023-af" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Approaches and Models for Teaching Digital Ethics in Information Systems Courses – A Review of the Literature</div> <div class="author"> Minna Paltiel, <em>Marc Cheong</em>, Simon Coghlan, and Reeva Lederman </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://journal.acs.org.au/index.php/ajis/article/view/4517" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The Australasian Journal of Information Systems is a refereed journal that publishes articles contributing to Information Systems theory and practice.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Coghlan2023-fl" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">To chat or bot to chat: Ethical issues with using chatbots in mental health</div> <div class="author"> Simon Coghlan, Kobi Leins, Susie Sheldrick, <em>Marc Cheong</em>, Piers Gooding, and Simon D’Alfonso </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/20552076231183542" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper presents a critical review of key ethical issues raised by the emergence of mental health chatbots. Chatbots use varying degrees of artificial intelligence and are increasingly deployed in many different domains including mental health. The technology may sometimes be beneficial, such as when it promotes access to mental health information and services. Yet, chatbots raise a variety of ethical concerns that are often magnified in people experiencing mental ill-health. These ethical challenges need to be appreciated and addressed throughout the technology pipeline. After identifying and examining four important ethical issues by means of a recognised ethical framework comprised of five key principles, the paper offers recommendations to guide chatbot designers, purveyers, researchers and mental health practitioners in the ethical creation and deployment of chatbots for mental health.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Cheong2023-gq" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Existentialism on social media</div> <div class="author"> <em>Marc Cheong</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/jhtr/article/view/7022" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Social media has become a basis for helping us maintain human contact, especially as our alienation from our phenomenological experiences of ‘being human’ is becoming apparent due to the pandemic. I argue for how existentialist philosophy is crucial, more than ever, to interrogate our social media usage, which is a ‘necessary evil’ in our daily lives. Firstly, Kierkegaard’s critiques of the crowd and of the press are equally applicable to social media, which plays both roles: enabling an anonymous mass of public opinion and doubling-up as an information source, reducing responsibility on the individual. Secondly, social media leads to an intrinsic pressure to objectify one’s self (as portrayed) due to the possibility of an omnipresent Other, based on the technological design of networks. I will link my arguments on social media to other existential ideals and will conclude by suggesting changes that may promote existential ideals in one’s social media portrayal and engagement.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Cohney2023-ib" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">COVID Down Under: where did Australia’s pandemic apps go wrong?</div> <div class="author"> Shaanan Cohney, and <em>Marc Cheong</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Ethics in Engineering, Science, and Technology (ETHICS)</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ETHICS57328.2023.10154912" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Governments and businesses worldwide deployed a variety of technological measures to help prevent and track the spread of COVID-19.

For example, this law means that insurance companies should not explicitly ask about legally protected attributes, e.g., race, in order to tailor their premiums to particular customers. In legal terms, indirect discrimination occurs when a generally neutral rule or variable is used, but significantly negatively affects one demographic group. An emerging example of this concern is inclusion of proxy variables in Machine Learning (ML) models, where neutral variables are predictive of protected attributes. For example, postcodes or zip codes are representative of communities, and therefore racial demographics and social-economic class; i.e., a traditional example of ‘redlining’ pre-dating modern automated techniques [1]. The law struggles with proxy variables in machine learning: indirect discrimination cases are difficult to bring to court, particularly because finding substantial evidence that shows the indirect discrimination to be unlawful is difficult [2]. With more complex machine-learning models being developed for automated decision making, e.g., random forests or state-of-the-art deep neural networks, more data points on customers are accumulated [1], from a wide variety of sources. With such rich data, ML models can produce multiple interconnected correlations - such as that found in single neurons in a neural network, or single decision trees in a random forest - which are predictive of protected attributes, akin to traditional uses of discrete proxy variables. In this poster, we introduce the concept of "emerging proxies", that are a combination of several variables, from which the ML model could infer the protected attribute(s) of the individuals in the dataset. This concept differs from the traditional concept of proxies because rather than addressing a single proxy variable, a distribution of interconnected proxies would have to be addressed. Our contribution is to provide evidence for the capacity of complex ML models to identify protected attributes through the correlation of other variables. This correlation is not made explicitly through a discrete one to one relationship between variables, but through a many-to-one relationship. This contribution complements concerns raised in legal analyses of automated decision-making about proxies in ML models leading to indirect discrimination [3]. Our contribution shows that if an ML model contains “emerging proxies” for a protected attribute, the distribution of proxies will be a roadblock when attempting to de-bias the model, limiting the pathways available for addressing potential discrimination caused by the ML model.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Caddy2023-qm" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">"Tell us what’s going on": Exploring the information needs of pregnant and post-partum women in Australia during the pandemic with ’Tweets’, ’Threads’, and women’s views</div> <div class="author"> Cassandra Caddy, <em>Marc Cheong</em>, Megan S C Lim, Robert Power, Joshua P Vogel, Zoe Bradfield, Benjamin Coghlan, Caroline S E Homer, and Alyce N Wilson </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279990" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>INTRODUCTION: The provision of maternity services in Australia has been significantly disrupted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many changes were initiated quickly, often with rapid dissemination of information to women. The aim of this study was to better understand what information and messages were circulating regarding COVID-19 and pregnancy in Australia and potential information gaps. METHODS: This study adopted a qualitative approach using social media and interviews. A data analytics tool (TIGER-C19) was used to extract data from social media platforms Reddit and Twitter from June to July 2021 (in the middle of the third COVID-19 wave in Australia). A total of 21 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with those who were, or had been, pregnant in Australia since March 2020. Social media data were analysis via inductive content analysis and interview data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Social media provided a critical platform for sharing and seeking information, as well as highlighting attitudes of the community towards COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. Women interviewed described wanting further information on the risks COVID-19 posed to themselves and their babies, and greater familiarity with the health service during pregnancy, in which they would labour and give birth. Health providers were a trusted source of information. Communication strategies that allowed participants to engage in real-time interactive discussions were preferred. A real or perceived lack of information led participants to turn to informal sources, increasing the potential for exposure to misinformation. CONCLUSION: It is vital that health services communicate effectively with pregnant women, early and often throughout public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This was particularly important during periods of increased restrictions on accessing hospital services. Information and communication strategies need to be clear, consistent, timely and accessible to reduce reliance on informal and potentially inaccurate sources.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Klein2023-oy" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The wisdom_of_crowds: An Efficient, Philosophically-Validated, Social Epistemological Network Profiling Toolkit</div> <div class="author"> Colin Klein, <em>Marc Cheong</em>, Marinus Ferreira, Emily Sullivan, and Mark Alfano </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Complex Networks and Their Applications XI</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-21127-0_6" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The epistemic position of an agent often depends on their position in a larger network of other agents who provide them with information.

[19] developed a method for quantitatively characterizing the epistemic position of individuals in a network that takes into account both diversity and independence and presented a proof-of-concept, closed-source implementation on a small graph derived from Twitter data [19]. This paper reports on an open-source re-implementation of their algorithm in Python, optimized to be usable on much larger networks. In addition to the algorithm and package, we also show the ability to scale up our package to large synthetic social network graph profiling, and finally demonstrate its utility in analyzing real-world empirical evidence of ‘echo chambers’ on online social media, as well as interdisciplinary diversity in an academic communications network.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Abedin2023-wa" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Exploring intellectual humility through the lens of artificial intelligence: Top terms, features and a predictive model</div> <div class="author"> Ehsan Abedin, Marinus Ferreira, Ritsaart Reimann, <em>Marc Cheong</em>, Igor Grossmann, and Mark Alfano </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691823001555" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Intellectual humility (IH) is often conceived as the recognition of, and appropriate response to, your own intellectual limitations.

This paper uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to develop a predictive model for IH and identify top terms and features that indicate degrees of IH. We trained our classifier on the dataset from an existing psychological study on IH, where participants were asked to journal their experiences with handling social conflicts over 30 days. We used Logistic Regression (LR) to train a classifier and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionaries for feature selection, picking out a range of word categories relevant to interpersonal relationships. Our results show that people who differ on IH do in fact systematically express themselves in different ways, including through expression of emotions (i.e., positive, negative, and specifically anger, anxiety, sadness, as well as the use of swear words), use of pronouns (i.e., first person, second person, and third person) and time orientation (i.e., past, present, and future tenses). We discuss the importance of these findings for IH and the value of using such techniques for similar psychological studies, as well as some ethical concerns and limitations with the use of such semi-automated classifications.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Cheong2023-ht" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Generative AIs: Epistemic injustice in AI, writ large?</div> <div class="author"> <em>Marc Cheong</em>, and E Abedin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 2023 Australasian Association of Philosophy Conference</em>, Melbourne, VIC., 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Fricker’s (2007) framework on epistemic injustice has been applied to Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, to explain the harm to epistemic agents who use and interact with such systems. These AI systems range from chatbots; to algorithmic decision-makers such as automated hiring systems; to social media recommenders. The rapid release, deployment, and use of Generative AI systems (GAIs) – fro text generators (e.g., ChatGPT) to image generators (e.g., DALL-E 2) – are a case in point. Users of GAIs running the risk of harm as knowers, based on the credibility excess afforded to the GAI, despite their propensity to ’hallucinate’ or make up facts. GAIs also inflict hermeneutical injustice, as their data models are not truly representative of society at large: an example is the issue of racial and gender biases in GAIs. Using empirical evidence from the modern crop of GAIs, this talk will illustrate the extent of epistemic injustice in GAIs, drawing upon Fricker (2007) as a framework. We will especially focus on how these injustices can be entrenched in such GAIs, owing to the way the data models are "updated" from version to version, and the ability for these GAIs to be ’cross-pollinated’ with other AI systems.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ruppanner2023-vi" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">2023 State of the future of work</div> <div class="author"> Leah Ruppanner, Brendan Churchill, David Bissell, Peter Ghin, Camilla Hydelund, Susan Ainsworth, Alysia Blackham, Jeff Borland, <em>Marc Cheong</em>, Michelle Evans, Lea Frermann, Tania King, and Frank Vetere </div> <div class="periodical"> 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2023-03/apo-nid322034.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 marc cheong.
