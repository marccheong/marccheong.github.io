My work deals with the analysis of contemporary social media from an existentialist lens, which has not been as actively researched since the days of de Beauvoir, Sartre, et al. My work currently challenges the notion of authenticity on social media, and why it runs counter to existentialist philosophy {% cite Cheong2023gq %}. Also, I've a special interest in looking at celebrity on social media {% cite Cheong2022fj %}.
