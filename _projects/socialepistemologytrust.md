title: 🤝 Social Epistemology, Digital Trust, and Social Psychology
description: I am interested in the intersection between computer science and philosophy - in particular how basic building blocks (of algorithms and programming languages) - have an impact on the human usage of systems, and their wider societal impact (for better or for worse).

I have been working together with Mark Alfano and his Digital Trust lab on applying data science and network analysis methods on the study of social epistemology. My contribution provides an empirical understanding of today's social media landscape. I am also passionate about empowering philosophers with state-of-the-art data science methods.

I am also part of a collaboration with Oliver Curry and team by contributing to digital 'machine reading morals' techniques. I contribute to data-driven analyses for Curry's Morality-as-Cooperation (MAC) Theory.
