Currently, in collaboration with The Burnet, I work in project teams studying user-generated social media responses to COVID-19 public health measures (TIGERC19) especially for pregnancy (SCOOP). I also co-supervise a PhD project on analysing how Caesarean sections are portrayed on Indonesian social media.

*Collaborators include:* Robert Power (The Burnet); Cassandra Caddy (The Burnet); Alyce Wilson & team (The Burnet); Rana Zahroh (PhD).

A previous study at Monash involved NLP methods for detecting markers of low mental health and well being (MHWB), including use of social media amongst university students to find out their usage motivations and how it affects MHWB. 

*Collaborators include:* Joanne Byrne (La Trobe); Yen Cheung (Monash); Eddie Robinson (Monash); Jojo Wong (La Trobe); Sudhir Mandarapu & Zhehui Yang (Honours, Monash)
