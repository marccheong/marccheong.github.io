I am active in Information Systems research looking at (social) impacts of technological systems, AI, and digitalisation in general. My scope of analysis ranges from the organisational level to the societal level.

My collaborations in IS blend theoretical foundations with new insights from philosophy, the social sciences, and higher education studies, amongst others.

*Collaborators include (from UniMelb unless otherwise stated):* Shanton Chang, Rashika Bahl* (*PhD candidate*), Dana McKay (RMIT), George Buchanan (RMIT), Davor Petreski* (*PhD candidate*), Carlo Perrotta, Peter Woelert, Julian Marx, Winn Chow, Sherah Kurnia, Susie Sheldrick, Ofir Turel, 
Hamed Qahri-Saremi (Colorado State University), Raffaele Ciriello (Sydney), Shreya Jha* (*PhD candidate*), Graham Sewell, and others...

My highlights in this space include:
* New York Times interview on Facebook's 2021 Australia news block.
* The Age interview on QR code adoption in Victoria during the Covid-19 pandemic.
* Ticker News interview on the 'hypocrisy of social media giants'.

Other past research projects include (a) pioneering several research techniques, including Twitter-based survey and sampling, as well as natural language processing (combined with my fortÃ© of metadata analysis) to identify marketing behviours of craft beer pioneers versus their mainstream counterparts {% cite Aleti2016iz %} and (b) analysing the discourse on Twitter for energy policy and contemporary energy-related issues in Australia {% cite Morgan2018gd %}.
