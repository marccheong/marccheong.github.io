  abstract     = {What is the cross-cultural prevalence of the seven moral
                  values posited by the theory of "morality-as-cooperation"?
                  Previous research, using laborious hand-coding of ethnographic
                  accounts of ethics from 60 societies, found examples of most
                  of the seven morals in most societies, and observed these
                  morals with equal frequency across cultural regions. Here we
                  replicate and extend this analysis by developing a new
                  Morality-as-Cooperation Dictionary (MAC-D) and using
                  Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) to machine-code
                  ethnographic accounts of morality from an additional 196
                  societies (the entire Human Relations Area Files, or HRAF,
                  corpus). Again, we find evidence of most of the seven morals
                  in most societies, across all cultural regions. The new method
                  allows us to detect minor variations in morals across region
                  and subsistence strategy. And we successfully validate the new
                  machine-coding against the previous hand-coding. In light of
                  these findings, MAC-D emerges as a theoretically-motivated,
                  comprehensive, and validated tool for machine-reading moral
                  corpora. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the
                  current study, as well as prospects for future research.},
