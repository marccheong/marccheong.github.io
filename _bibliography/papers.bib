  abstract  = {Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter/X, or TikTok are
               controlled by and rely on a single service provider. However,
               repeated controversies around data breaches, algorithmic bias, or
               misinformation have eroded trust in these centralised platforms.
               Concurrently, advancements in blockchain technology have opened
               avenues for decentralised social media that distribute control
               and data across a network of participants, thereby challenging
               their centralised counterparts. This study reviews existing
               literature on the topic and finds that what we know largely
               focuses on the technological implementation of decentralised
               social media. Therefore, we surveyed the literature for
               socio-technical dimensions of the phenomenon and found that
               control, privacy, operation, security, rewards, adoption, and
               research are central themes in this regard. We use those themes
               to derive recommendations for future research in Information
               Systems (IS) and beyond that aims to unpack individual,
               organisational, and societal implications of decentralised social
               media.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionCaesarean section (CS) rates in Indonesia are
                  increasing rapidly. Understanding women’s preferences about
                  mode of birth is important to help contextualise these rising
                  rates and can help develop interventions to optimise CS. This
                  study aimed to explore Indonesian women’s preferences and
                  decision-making about mode of birth, and how their preferences
                  may change throughout pregnancy and birth.MethodsWe conducted
                  a longitudinal qualitative study using in-depth interviews
                  with 28 women accessing private and public health facilities
                  in Jakarta, the region with the highest CS rates. Interviews
                  were conducted two times: during the woman’s third trimester
                  of pregnancy and in the postpartum period, between October
                  2022 and March 2023. We used a reflexive thematic approach for
                  analysis.ResultsWe generated three themes: (1) preferences
                  about the mode of birth, (2) decision-making about the mode of
                  birth and (3) regrets about the actual mode of birth. Most
                  women preferred vaginal birth. However, they were influenced
                  by advertisements promoting enhanced recovery after CS (ERACS)
                  as an ‘advanced technique’ of CS, promising a comfortable,
                  painless and faster recovery birth. This messaging influenced
                  women to perceive CS as equivalent or even superior to vaginal
                  birth. Where women’s preferences for mode of birth shifted
                  around the time of birth, this was primarily due to the
                  obstetricians’ discretion. Women felt they did not receive
                  adequate information from obstetricians on the benefits and
                  risks of CS and vaginal birth and felt disappointed when their
                  actual mode of birth was not aligned with their
                  preferences.ConclusionOur study shows that despite rising CS
                  rates, Indonesian women prefer vaginal birth. This highlights
                  the need for better communication strategies and
                  evidence-based information from healthcare providers. Given
                  the rising popularity of ERACS, more work is urgently needed
                  to standardise and regulate its use.},

  abstract     = {Background: The development of AI-enabled software heavily
                  depends on AI model documentation, such as model cards, due to
                  different domain expertise between software engineers and
                  model developers. From an ethical standpoint, AI model
                  documentation conveys critical information on ethical
                  considerations along with mitigation strategies for downstream
                  developers to ensure the delivery of ethically compliant
                  software. However, knowledge on such documentation practice
                  remains scarce. Aims: The objective of our study is to
                  investigate how developers document ethical aspects of open
                  source AI models in practice, aiming at providing
                  recommendations for future documentation endeavours. Method:
                  We selected three sources of documentation on GitHub and
                  Hugging Face, and developed a keyword set to identify
                  ethics-related documents systematically. After filtering an
                  initial set of 2,347 documents, we identified 265 relevant
                  ones and performed thematic analysis to derive the themes of
                  ethical considerations. Results: Six themes emerge, with the
                  three largest ones being model behavioural risks, model use
                  cases, and model risk mitigation. Conclusions: Our findings
                  reveal that open source AI model documentation focuses on
                  articulating ethical problem statements and use case
                  restrictions. We further provide suggestions to various
                  stakeholders for improving documentation practice regarding
                  ethical considerations.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly being
                  used not only to classify and analyze but also to generate
                  images and text. As recent work on the content produced by
                  text and image Generative AIs has shown (e.g., Cheong et al.,
                  2024, Acerbi \& Stubbersfield, 2023), there is a risk that
                  harms of representation and bias, already documented in prior
                  AI and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms may also
                  be present in generative models. These harms relate to
                  protected categories such as gender, race, age, and religion.
                  There are several kinds of harms of representation to consider
                  in this context, including stereotyping, lack of recognition,
                  denigration, under-representation, and many others (Crawford
                  in Soundings 41:45–55, 2009; in: Barocas et al., SIGCIS
                  Conference, 2017). Whereas the bulk of researchers’ attention
                  thus far has been given to stereotyping and denigration, in
                  this study we examine ‘exnomination’, as conceived by Roland
                  Barthes (1972), of religious groups. Our case study is DALL-E,
                  a tool that generates images from natural language prompts.
                  Using DALL-E mini, we generate images from generic prompts
                  such as “religious person.” We then examine whether the
                  generated images are recognizably members of a nominated
                  group. Thus, we assess whether the generated images normalize
                  some religions while neglecting others. We hypothesize that
                  Christianity will be recognizably represented more frequently
                  than other religious groups. Our results partially support
                  this hypothesis but introduce further complexities, which we
                  then explore.},

                  values posited by the theory of "morality-as-cooperation"?
                  Previous research, using laborious hand-coding of ethnographic
                  accounts of ethics from 60 societies, found examples of most
                  of the seven morals in most societies, and observed these
                  morals with equal frequency across cultural regions. Here we
                  replicate and extend this analysis by developing a new
                  Morality-as-Cooperation Dictionary (MAC-D) and using
                  Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) to machine-code
                  ethnographic accounts of morality from an additional 196
                  societies (the entire Human Relations Area Files, or HRAF,
                  corpus). Again, we find evidence of most of the seven morals
                  in most societies, across all cultural regions. The new method
                  allows us to detect minor variations in morals across region
                  and subsistence strategy. And we successfully validate the new
                  machine-coding against the previous hand-coding. In light of
                  these findings, MAC-D emerges as a theoretically-motivated,
                  comprehensive, and validated tool for machine-reading moral
                  corpora. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the

These tools, while impressive, are liable to reproduce, exacerbate, and reinforce extant human social biases, such as gender and racial biases. In this article, we systematically review the extent to which DALL-E Mini suffers from this problem. In line with the Model Card published alongside DALL-E Mini by its creators, we find that the images it produces tend to represent dozens of different occupations as populated either solely by men (e.g., pilot, builder, plumber) or solely by women (e.g., hairdresser, receptionist, dietitian). In addition, the images DALL-E Mini produces tend to represent most occupations as populated primarily or solely by White people (e.g., farmer, painter, prison officer, software engineer) and very few by non-White people (e.g., pastor, rapper). These findings suggest that exciting new AI technologies should be critically scrutinized and perhaps regulated before they are unleashed on society.},

                  contact, especially as our alienation from our
                  phenomenological experiences of ‘being human’ is becoming
                  apparent due to the pandemic. I argue for how existentialist
                  philosophy is crucial, more than ever, to interrogate our
                  social media usage, which is a ‘necessary evil’ in our daily
                  lives. Firstly, Kierkegaard’s critiques of the crowd and of
                  the press are equally applicable to social media, which plays
                  both roles: enabling an anonymous mass of public opinion and
                  doubling-up as an information source, reducing responsibility
                  on the individual. Secondly, social media leads to an
                  intrinsic pressure to objectify one's self (as portrayed) due
                  to the possibility of an omnipresent Other, based on the
                  technological design of networks. I will link my arguments on
                  social media to other existential ideals and will conclude by
                  suggesting changes that may promote existential ideals in
                  one’s social media portrayal and engagement.},

               technological measures to help prevent and track the spread of
               COVID-19. In Australia, these applications contained usability,
               accessibility, and security flaws that hindered their
               effectiveness and adoption. Australia, like most countries, has
               transitioned to treating COVID as endemic. However it is yet to
               absorb lessons from the technological issues with its approach to
               the pandemic. In this short paper we a) provide a systematization

  abstract  = {Anti-discrimination law in many jurisdictions effectively bans
               the use of race and gender in automated decision-making. For
               example, this law means that insurance companies should not
               explicitly ask about legally protected attributes, e.g., race, in
               order to tailor their premiums to particular customers. In legal
               terms, indirect discrimination occurs when a generally neutral
               rule or variable is used, but significantly negatively affects
               one demographic group. An emerging example of this concern is
               inclusion of proxy variables in Machine Learning (ML) models,
               where neutral variables are predictive of protected attributes.
               For example, postcodes or zip codes are representative of
               communities, and therefore racial demographics and
               social-economic class; i.e., a traditional example of ‘redlining’
               pre-dating modern automated techniques [1]. The law struggles
               with proxy variables in machine learning: indirect discrimination
               cases are difficult to bring to court, particularly because
               finding substantial evidence that shows the indirect
               discrimination to be unlawful is difficult [2]. With more complex
               machine-learning models being developed for automated decision
               making, e.g., random forests or state-of-the-art deep neural
               networks, more data points on customers are accumulated [1], from
               a wide variety of sources. With such rich data, ML models can
               produce multiple interconnected correlations - such as that found
               in single neurons in a neural network, or single decision trees
               in a random forest - which are predictive of protected
               attributes, akin to traditional uses of discrete proxy variables.
               In this poster, we introduce the concept of "emerging proxies",
               that are a combination of several variables, from which the ML
               model could infer the protected attribute(s) of the individuals
               in the dataset. This concept differs from the traditional concept
               of proxies because rather than addressing a single proxy
               variable, a distribution of interconnected proxies would have to
               be addressed. Our contribution is to provide evidence for the
               capacity of complex ML models to identify protected attributes
               through the correlation of other variables. This correlation is
               not made explicitly through a discrete one to one relationship
               between variables, but through a many-to-one relationship. This
               contribution complements concerns raised in legal analyses of
               automated decision-making about proxies in ML models leading to
               indirect discrimination [3]. Our contribution shows that if an ML
               model contains “emerging proxies” for a protected attribute, the
               distribution of proxies will be a roadblock when attempting to
               de-bias the model, limiting the pathways available for addressing
               potential discrimination caused by the ML model.},

  abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: The provision of maternity services in Australia
                  has been significantly disrupted in response to the COVID-19
                  pandemic. Many changes were initiated quickly, often with
                  rapid dissemination of information to women. The aim of this
                  study was to better understand what information and messages
                  were circulating regarding COVID-19 and pregnancy in Australia
                  and potential information gaps. METHODS: This study adopted a
                  qualitative approach using social media and interviews. A data
                  analytics tool (TIGER-C19) was used to extract data from
                  social media platforms Reddit and Twitter from June to July
                  2021 (in the middle of the third COVID-19 wave in Australia).
                  A total of 21 individual semi-structured interviews were
                  conducted with those who were, or had been, pregnant in
                  Australia since March 2020. Social media data were analysis
                  via inductive content analysis and interview data were
                  thematically analysed. RESULTS: Social media provided a
                  critical platform for sharing and seeking information, as well
                  as highlighting attitudes of the community towards COVID-19
                  vaccines in pregnancy. Women interviewed described wanting
                  further information on the risks COVID-19 posed to themselves
                  and their babies, and greater familiarity with the health
                  service during pregnancy, in which they would labour and give
                  birth. Health providers were a trusted source of information.
                  Communication strategies that allowed participants to engage
                  in real-time interactive discussions were preferred. A real or
                  perceived lack of information led participants to turn to
                  informal sources, increasing the potential for exposure to
                  misinformation. CONCLUSION: It is vital that health services
                  communicate effectively with pregnant women, early and often
                  throughout public health crises, such as the COVID-19
                  pandemic. This was particularly important during periods of
                  increased restrictions on accessing hospital services.
                  Information and communication strategies need to be clear,
                  consistent, timely and accessible to reduce reliance on
                  informal and potentially inaccurate sources.},

                  recognition of, and appropriate response to, your own
                  intellectual limitations. As far as we are aware, only a
                  handful of studies look at interventions to increase IH – e.g.
                  through journalling – and no study so far explores the extent
                  to which having high or low IH can be predicted. This paper
                  uses machine learning and natural language processing
                  techniques to develop a predictive model for IH and identify
                  top terms and features that indicate degrees of IH. We trained
                  our classifier on the dataset from an existing psychological
                  study on IH, where participants were asked to journal their
                  experiences with handling social conflicts over 30 days. We
                  used Logistic Regression (LR) to train a classifier and the
                  Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionaries for
                  feature selection, picking out a range of word categories
                  relevant to interpersonal relationships. Our results show that
                  people who differ on IH do in fact systematically express
                  themselves in different ways, including through expression of
                  emotions (i.e., positive, negative, and specifically anger,
                  anxiety, sadness, as well as the use of swear words), use of
                  pronouns (i.e., first person, second person, and third person)
                  and time orientation (i.e., past, present, and future tenses).
                  We discuss the importance of these findings for IH and the
                  value of using such techniques for similar psychological
                  studies, as well as some ethical concerns and limitations with
                  the use of such semi-automated classifications.},

                 ChatGPT) to image generators (e.g., DALL-E 2) -- are a case in

                 on the credibility excess afforded to the GAI, despite their

                 can be entrenched in such GAIs, owing to the way the data
                 models are "updated" from version to version, and the ability

                  vaccination have become more polarized. This is an
                  observational study of Twitter analyzing the impact that
                  COVID-19 had on vaccine discourse. We identify the actors, the
                  language they use, how their language changed, and what can
                  explain this change. First, we find that authors cluster into
                  several large, interpretable groups, and that the discourse
                  was greatly affected by American partisan politics. Over the
                  course of our study, both Republicans and Democrats entered
                  the vaccine conversation in large numbers, forming coalitions
                  with Antivaxxers and public health organizations,
                  respectively. After the pandemic was officially declared, the
                  interactions between these groups increased. Second, we show
                  that the moral and non-moral language used by the various
                  communities converged in interesting and informative ways.
                  Finally, vector autoregression analysis indicates that
                  differential responses to public health measures are likely
                  part of what drove this convergence. Taken together, our

               bias in NLP. However, the manifestation of gendered language in
               application materials has received limited attention. This paper
               investigates the framing of skills and background in CVs of
               self-identified men and women. We introduce a data set of 1.8K
               authentic, English-language, CVs from the US, covering 16
               occupations, allowing us to partially control for the confound
               occupation-specific gender base rates. We find that (1) women use
               more verbs evoking impressions of low power; and (2) classifiers
               capture gender signal even after data balancing and removal of
               pronouns and named entities, and this holds for both
               transformer-based and linear classifiers.},

                  migrated to the digital space, such images and slogans have
                  also gone online. Two main ways in which these images and

                  crucial role in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. The
                  immediate, flexible nature of tweets plays a crucial role both
                  in spreading information about the movement’s aims and in
                  organizing individual protests. Twitter has also played an
                  important role in the right-wing reaction to BLM, providing a
                  means to reframe and recontextualize activists’ claims in a
                  more sinister light. The ability to bring about social change
                  depends on the balance of these two forces, and in particular
                  which side can capture and maintain sustained attention. The
                  present study examines 2 years worth of tweets about BLM
                  (about 118 million in total). Timeseries analysis reveals that
                  activists are better at mobilizing rapid attention, whereas
                  right-wing accounts show a pattern of moderate but more
                  sustained activity driven by reaction to political opponents.
                  Topic modeling reveals differences in how different political
                  groups talk about BLM. Most notably, the murder of George
                  Floyd appears to have solidified a right-wing counter-framing
                  of protests as arising from dangerous “terrorist” actors. The
                  study thus sheds light on the complex network and rhetorical
                  effects that drive the struggle for online attention to the
                  BLM movement.},

                  as there seems, but there are structural features that make
                  resistance seem worse than it is. Here, we describe two ways
                  that the problem seeming to be worse than it is can make it
                  worse. First, visible hesitation to implement COVID-19
                  responses signals to the wider society that mitigation
                  measures may not succeed, which undermines people?s
                  conditional willingness to join in on those efforts. Second,
                  our evaluations of others? willingness to implement these
                  measures are informed by our attempts to mind-read them. Yet
                  attempts to mind-read groups often mislead us, because groups
                  invariably act from diverse motives, whereas mind-reading
                  works best when identifying relatively stable and consistent
                  motivations. This means that a small minority of people
                  refusing to implement measures can have an outsized prominence
                  that prompts mind-reading to diagnose widespread hesitation.
                  These two factors form a feedback loop with each other: we see
                  some people?s hesitation, which prompts us to mind-read other
                  people as being more uncertain about the responses than they
                  actually are, which undermines our confidence in the
                  responses, which in turn encourages others to mind-read this
                  hesitation, which further undermines confidence.},

                  ranging from the use of digital tools in health to predictive

                  One way to measure diversity is to apply analytical research
                  methods to data sourced from the public domain for use in
                  research. However, attempts to measure diversity using public
                  data may themselves raise legal and ethical questions about

                  guardrails to better balance public interests in research and

  abstract= {The rise of social media mediated celebrity culture raises several philosophical concerns. It is not uncommon to see, for example, Hollywood actors being placed in the same bracket as YouTube artists and Instagram influencers. The increased perceived ‘connectivity’ afforded by social media allows online celebrities to reach more fans and increases the perceived engagement or intimacy in the fan-celebrity relationship. In the present article I argue that this online relationship, which is beneficial to celebrities (for brand development) and social media companies (in profiting from the high engagement), has the potential to cause harm to both the celebrities as well as their fanbases (and sometimes innocent third parties). Firstly, I argue that celebrities’ attempts to be more intimate or authentic with their fanbase can turn out to be – more often than not – acts of Sartrean bad faith. Celebrities who tend to project a certain self-styled ‘online authenticity’, given the context of social media’s attention economy, can run the risk of treating a fan as a means-to-an-end, rather than an autonomous for-itself. Secondly, I argue that this phenomenon can catalyse real-world harms, by drawing upon network theory and social psychology. I argue that the connectedness of social media, ‘blending into the crowd’, and social media technologies’ ethos of optimising-for-engagement, leads to real harms to human wellbeing when fans do not engage critically and mindfully with online celebrities. Examples include Trump-esque celebrity politicians trying to drum up populist influence; celebrities feuding online encouraging fans’ conduct of harmful trolling and harassment; and vilification of those who do not subscribe to the same perceived worldview of a celebrity’s fandom. Following my arguments within, I shall outline an online celebrity’s ethical duties in their social media engagement, with emphasis on the duties that celebrity status comes with, particularly in preventing harms that transcend the online into the offline.},

               digital ethics education in Information Systems and related
               fields. The importance of teaching digital ethics to students
               studying information and communication technologies (ICT) is
               increasingly recognised. However, it is unclear how ethics should
               best be taught to these future ICT practitioners. Using a
               narrative literature review methodology to explore existing
               scholarly work, this paper identifies five pedagogical theories
               related to digital ethics education. Additionally, the paper
               outlines approaches that deploy standalone ethics units,
               integrated ethics teaching, and hybrid teaching approaches, and
               identifies the employment of and emphasis given to various moral
               theories in digital ethics education. The paper then discusses
               how these three sets of findings—namely, different pedagogical
               approaches, degree of integration of ethics teaching, and use of
               moral theories—are related to each other. It provides educators
               with information and reflections to consider when designing
               digital ethics teaching.},

               universal of grief. According to philosophers, obituaries are a
               ritualized way of evaluating both individuals who have passed
               away and the communities that helped to shape them. The basic
               idea is that you can tell what it takes to count as a good person
               of a particular type in a particular community by seeing how
               persons of that type are described and celebrated in their
               obituaries. Obituaries of those killed in conflict, in
               particular, are rich repositories of communal values, as they
               reflect the values and virtues that are admired and respected in
               individuals who are considered to be heroes in their communities.
               In this paper, we use natural language processing techniques to
               map the patterns of values and virtues attributed to Australian
               military personnel who were killed in action during World War I
               and World War II. Doing so reveals several clusters of values and
               virtues that tend to be attributed together. In addition, we use
               named entity recognition and geotagging the track the movements
               of these soldiers to various theatres of the wars, including
               North Africa, Europe, and the Pacific.},

                  in the attention economy by unduly influencing or manipulating
                  consumers’ decision-making, and also by narrowing the product

                  self-radicalization, which can lead to behaviors ranging from
                  lone-wolf terrorism to participation in white nationalist
                  rallies to mundane bigotry and voting for extremist
                  candidates. However, the mechanisms by which the Internet
                  facilitates self-radicalization are disputed; some fault the
                  individuals who end up self-radicalized, while others lay the

                  self-radicalization in its myriad guises, encompassing extreme
                  as well as more mundane forms. We begin by characterizing the

                  between top-down seduction and bottom-up seduction. We then

                  theoretical model of dynamical systems theory. We conclude by
